**Unit 3: Decision Support Systems** <span id="3"></span> 
*Decision support systems (DSS) are computerized systems developed to
assist decision making.  In this unit, you will learn basic premises of
decision support systems and their applications in supporting
engineering design.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 12 hours to complete.
