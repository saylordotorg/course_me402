**Unit 1: Introduction To Design Decisions** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit provides an overview of the process of making decisions for
engineering design.  Subunit 1.1 will refresh what you learned in
previous courses about design process.  In subunit 1.2, you will learn
how economic considerations affect a design.  These decisions can make a
company economically successful.  Decisions pertaining to life cycle
cost payback, taxes, and cash flow go a long way in determining the
long-term viability of a design or product.  In subunits 1.3 and 1.4,
you will learn about the anatomy of decision making in general and for
engineering design specifically. *

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 22 hours to complete.
