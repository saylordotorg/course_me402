**Unit 2: Methods, Theories, And Tools** <span id="2"></span> 
*There exist a large number of theories and tools that provide support
for engineering design.  In this unit, you will be introduced to a
variety of tools used for obtaining inputs from stakeholders, for
addressing variability, quality, and uncertainty in design process and
for generating alternatives for designers.  We will rely on the* *book,*
Approaches to Improve Engineering Design, *published by National Academy
of Engineering, to provide the high-level description of each method and
tool.  You also will find more expanded readings and lectures for a
selected number of methods and tools. *

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 22 hours to complete.

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Explain and implement concurrent engineering.
-   Identify and explain the use of tools used to obtain inputs from
    stakeholders, to address variability, quality, and uncertainty in
    design process, and to generate alternatives for designers.

    involves getting the right people together at the right time to
    resolve design problems.  In concurrent engineering, diverse
    functional activities are done simultaneously, promoting decisions
    to be made without complete information, sharing of product
    requirements, and effective assessment of risks.  This reading will
    take approximately 1 hour to complete.
