**Unit 4: Mathematical Tools For Decision Making** <span id="4"></span> 
*An engineering designer should always validate decisions with
mathematical data and analysis.  Accordingly, Unit 4 will cover the
mathematical concepts and tools needed to make design decisions.  You
will learn various operational research/optimization tools, including
the linear and dynamic programming method.  You also will learn how to
develop algorithms and techniques for analyzing project path and how to
conduct supply chain and transportation analysis.  These tools and
techniques will help you make sound design decisions supported by
mathematical data.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 52 hours to complete.
