Engineering design is the process of creating solutions to satisfy
certain requirements given all the constraints.   This course will focus
on the decision-making process that affects various stages of design,
including resource allocation, scheduling, facilities management,
material procurement, inspection, and quality control.  You will be
introduced to the basic theoretical framework and several practical
tools you can use to support decision making in the future.  The first
two units provide an overview of engineering design process and theories
and methods for making decisions, including Analytic Hierarchy Process,
Lean Six Sigma, and Quality Function Deployment.  In Unit 3, you will
learn about the basic principles of computerized decision support
systems.  Unit 4 discusses several advanced mathematical methods used
for support decision making, including linear and dynamic programming,
decision tree, and Bayesian inference.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   Make decisions given one or more design constraints.
-   Explain and use different techniques such as Pugh Method, Quality
    Function Deployment, Decision Matrix, and Analytic Hierarchy
    Processto obtain inputs from key stakeholders.
-   Explain the principles of and apply methods and tools such as Lean
    Six Sigma to address variability, quality, and uncertainty.
-   Use mathematical tools such as linear programming, dynamic
    programming, probability analysis, and decision tree in decision
    making.
-   Use decision support systems (DSS) in application to solve complex
    engineering design problems under conflicting objectives and
    uncertainty.
-   Evaluate the implications of economic considerations on design
    decisions.

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Units 1 and 2, as these units lay the
groundwork for understanding the more advanced, exploratory
material presented in the later units.  You also will need to complete
all the assignments, quizzes, and the final exam.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the resources in each unit.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the final exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment**: The materials for this course will take
approximately **108 hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time
advisory” that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on
each subunit.  These should help you plan your time accordingly.  In
addition, each reading, lecture, or assignment also will provide you
with an estimate of how long it will take to complete each item.  Feel
free to spend more time on sections that you want to learn more about.
